1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,The benefits plus company culture is great.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I feel like as i3 is growing we are losing site of some of our culture. I think we need to either embrace the changes (ie 9/80 schedule, remote working, etc) and accept that we will not have that culture or we need to refocus on our initial culture push and evaluate some of the upper management that is not at all embracing that ""original culture"". 

Our PM team could do better at working with their backshop folks and operations could do ALOT more to help with communication including tracking of items as we continue to grow bigger. Neither the PM group or the Ops group appear to have clear direction across all programs."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Does this matter? They seem to win regardless.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"The phrase ""Our culture"" is often repeated when talking about i3, but it appears to be a mere buzzword for the leadership, with no real action taken to support it. The culture emphasizes teamwork and problem-solving, but the work environment, represented by a generic cube farm, has a negative impact on well-being, health, productivity, and face-to-face interactions. There is also a lack of a flexible work schedule for the headquarters, leading employees to feel like they are just numbers on a spreadsheet that can be easily replaced. Additionally, the overall compensation package at i3 falls significantly short compared to other companies in the area. It's not uncommon for employees to discover that they are earning tens of thousands of dollars less than their peers in the same field, even if they have more experience. All of this is contributing to our retention problem."

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"Honestly, as a contractor, my focus is on the project work. I feel that corporate takes good care of me. Many questions are irrelevant as my immediate coworkers are not i3."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,i3 is a great organization that values its employees and is focused on their development.

I am proud of being a current member of i3 and look forward to continued success with them.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,The company has the best culture I've experienced in my career and the work is exceptional.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,I3 has been a wonderful experience.  My previous organization was poorly managed and did not do anything to help individuals.  I3 actually cares about their employees and want them to have fun.  The benefits are great and the parties can get a little wild.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,i3 is a fantastic company to work for and I highly recommend anyone work for this company.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I3 has been overall a great experience. I was hired on while I was pregnant, and everyone was more than happy they were excited for me. They did everything they could to make sure my salary, career, and family goals were all met. I have been debating going back to school and they are nothing but supportive. Another plus is the office. Working in the i3 building is so comforting and cozy that it takes the sting out of having to work from the office. Overall, I have been working at i3 for almost a year now and I have not had one bad experience yet! And talk about feeling special during the holidays just a great place to work!"

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,I have the greatest opportunities to succeed in my career at i3
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Organization has a great culture.  Our group is left alone to manage itself so we get our work done.  I understand how this group fits into the bigger picture
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I don't feel like I have an opportunity to advance and at this point, I am looking into career changes at this point, though, so it is a moot point. I am not looking into a career change because of i3, however. I want to be clear that I am doing that because I feel like I'm being called (as a Christian) into that change and not the result of poor treatment (though this may be saying enough that those who know, know who I am in this anonymous survey)."

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,The organization's culture has diminished the last 2 years. They no longer care about the employees and growing and developing them.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I rated the organization the way I did, because I'm an employee that appreciates, maintains, and demonstrates indivisible integrity; so, grateful that many other team members mirror identical standards of conduct - hopefully, those same ethics will permeate throughout our industry."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"i3 is an an incredible place to work. Each team member is recognized, and we are not just a number in the database of employees."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Working at i3 feels like a big family. Great atmosphere. Great opportunities and great leadership.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Overall the company is an amazing place to work.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"Over the past years of working for this company I have found that culture and engagement has moved more towards profit and year over year growth. ESOP is often used as a culture crutch for bad decision making and ineffective communication. We have leaders that consistently demonstrate they care only for the bottom line and fail to invest in people. 

We are often told to bring these issues with open door policies that provide lip service without any real action. The Cultural lead herself often engages in crossing personal and private life information for the sake of gossip. We have IT leadership that doesn't know how to back up data, nor install port security. Program Management is often fumbled with incompetent leaders forced to 'sink or 'swim'. 

This is not the Best Place to Work."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Best Place to Work!

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I've worked for I3 for over 5 years, and I love working for them. I was given opportunity to move to another location and absolutely love my job and the people. My gov POC is great and engages with all of us.

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"My organization provides me with the ability to go after new work opportunities and provides assistance if needed, to include proposal writing, management insight, corporate vision and direction wrt new opportunities.

I also have trust that they will complete their task so when the deadlines arrive everyone has done their part and we are all ready.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"i3 is widely regarding in Huntsville as one of the premier places to work.

This is only my second company to work for since retiring from a 25+ year active duty military career but the experience has been great. I have not only enjoyed the work environment but have appreciated the outside of work family events that they also host on a regular basis. The additional benefit that i3 recently became a 100% employee owned business is just another added benefit that has developed during my time with the company.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,It is amazing.  I have worked at some really bad places and i3 is so far above and beyond anything i ever thought a company could be to work for.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Great place to work! Earn a living while making a difference.
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"Great company, great work, great benefits and I feel involved."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I have worked at few contractors in the area and this company really backs what they are doing.

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,".  I had a friend that worked for i3 and told me how great the company was, and that they were the best company he's ever worked for.
 I applied for a position with the company in 2018 and was hired shortly after.  Everything my friend told me about i3 was absolutely true.  I'm in my mid 40's and out of all the employers I've worked for over the years i3 is by far my favorite.  
i3 puts the employees first. They go out of their way to make sure we are taken care of. 
 They have many events throughout the year we're employees can get together and mingle with other employees, and everyone in leadership. 
 They are very transparent, and communicate all facets of the business with us. 
 I worked very hard on my project for a couple of years, and i3 noticed my efforts and value and gave me a raise.  
I could go on, but i will just reiterate that i3 is by far the best employer I've had in the 25 years of my career, and I'm very proud to be their employee."

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"My entire experience with i3 has been outstanding!  I was warmly welcome when I joined, and I am consistently valued, appreciated, and encouraged daily to grow as a person while I deliver the absolute best services to our customers."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,The organization has helped me both professionally and personally. I have been a part of several companies and have never felt the sense of belonging and ability to share any issues with management.

1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,Great place to work
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"I came onboard from another company where I had been 30 years and laid off.  In the initial interview, I threw out a salary number - which I felt was unrealistic - and i3 was ""that's doable"".  I have received 3 Christmas bonuses - totally unexpected - and 3 spot bonuses for merit - they definitely recognize good work and if the govt customer happens to mention a team member by name.  AMAZING!!!!  i3 also schedules/scheduled - pre-covid and post-covid - both formal get togethers - summer picnic, Christmas party but also quarterly pizza get togethers or pub crawls.  They have classes for financial planning/insurance needs/retirement planning - AMAZING.
Cannot say enough on how welcoming they have been to me."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,By far the BEST place I have EVER worked!
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"The overall organization is one of the best around, if not the best, around.  The overall atmosphere is one of Team/Family.  Benefits are outstanding.  So the next comments will identify me as someone working outside of Corporate.  Over the years being here I've continually heard that we like to promote from within, and I've seen that, but it appears to be promoting those at Corporate.  There have been a few that have been promoted within as Leads as a Contractor, it's the ability to move into a position within Corporate if you are outside that is disappointing.  If you apply for a position, especially since you are a member of i3, you would expect someone to let you know you didn't get the position and possibly why.  The why part is part of mentoring and trying to build the company from within.  It's just disappointing that that doesn't, at least in my experience.  I still Love the company and Senior Leadership is incredible. it's what happens below that is concerning because it appears hiring is secretive and really doesn't matter what your qualifications are since there is probably someone else already identified.  Again, I Love i3 it's just kind of disheartening."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"The company doesn't use performance metrics. Instead, recognition is based on customer feedback. This leaves a situation where it's possible to be amazing at your job, but an indifferent customer never gives feedback on you. There is a perception that remote workers are viewed as less dedicated by leadership."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"Compared to all my previous jobs, this organization is the best I've ever worked in."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"The org is decent. Over the years it has drifted away from being people focused to being more profit focused. That is great for a business, but poor for loyalty and retention. I feel I work hard, others within my group do very little and that is tolerated. As long as the customer isn't upset, the minimum is considered sufficient."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"The culture at i3 is like no other - it's inclusive, promotes personal and professional growth, and rewards you for a job well done."
1,Please explain why you rated the organization as you did.,"i3 truly cares about its employees and shows it through actions and works every day, not just slogans on the wall."

5,General Comments,"We learned during COVID that remote work is 100% possible and reasonable for many people. Going back on that is a huge step backwards. The decision to force everyone who is local in the area to come in to the office suddenly is not only unfair to them, but also disrespectful of the work that they did while working remote that whole time. Forcing in-person work communicates the idea that the work we did while working remote has been invalid and of poor-quality, while our company's growth that has been bragged about during meetings says the complete opposite of that."

5,General Comments,Our leadership is losing sight of remaining approachable and open with their team. They have done such a good job but we can see them making less of an effort since we have relocated to the new building. It would be great to see them trying to connect with the different groups throughout the company like they did a few years ago.
5,General Comments,"There is a prevailing notion that individuals are reluctant to work and prefer a leisurely lifestyle at home, but this notion must be challenged. The reality is that people seek balance and the ability to manage their life effectively. There will always be work to be done, no matter how many hours are invested each day. However, life is a precious and finite commodity, and should take precedence over work. The company should embrace this perspective and prioritize life over work, recognizing that when one individual leaves, there will always be someone to fill their role."""

5,General Comments,"my husband had a traumatic accident last January which results in 3 surgeries on his leg and was in a wheelchair for over 10 months before finally being able to walk.  I kept i3 apprised of what I needed to do to support him - they were wonderful!  My co-workers helped me with my work when needed, I was checked on, upper management checked on us, when we were told to come back to RSA, I spoke with my leads and they were all ""stay at home as long as you need"", ""take what time you need"" - they were so encouraging, let me make my own hours and telework as needed.  
Hope to stay here until I retire in 8+ years!"
